# PCB USB PORT

I made a usb extender. You can now plug in 1 extra usb instead of just one.<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

about $60 total<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

some challenges were that I had to improvise the position of the design, and also kinda named stuff wierdly like hi!<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
